## 概念

### Longitudinalis轴

Longitudinal planes refer to the vertically-oriented planes which are aligned along the long axis of the body. These could be sagittal or coronal.

Both sagittal and coronal longitudinal planes perpendicularly intersect the transverse (or horizontal) plane.

#### Coronalis冠状
Coronal plane (a.k.a. frontal plane) refers to a vertically-oriented, side-to-side plane which, when passes through the body in its anatomical position, divides it into anterior and posterior parts.

The coronal plane lies at right angle to the vertically-oriented sagittal plane, while it perpendicularly intersects the transverse (a.k.a. horizontal) plane.
冠状面Coronal section，又称额状面frontal plane，即从左右方向，沿人体的长轴将人体纵切为前、后两部分的切面。这种提法是为了在临床中将器官位置描述的更具体。

Coronal与Frontal是因为解剖对象是站立或趴着

#### Sagittal矢状
Sagittal plane refers to a vertically-oriented, antero-posterior plane which, when passes through the body in its anatomical position, divides it into right and left parts.

The sagittal plane lies at right angle to the vertically-oriented coronal plane, while it perpendicularly intersects the transverse (a.k.a. horizontal) plane.
矢状面Median sagittal section就是把人体分成左右两面的解剖面，与这个面平行的也是矢状面

### Axialis轴
上下方向的切割平面
Axial (a.k.a. transverse) plane refers to a horizontally-oriented plane which, when passes through the body in its anatomical position, divides it into upper and lower parts.

The axial plane is intersected at right angles by the vertically-oriented coronal (side-to-side) and sagittal (antero-posterior) planes.

#### Transversus横
Transverse (a.k.a. axial) plane refers to a horizontally-oriented plane which, when passes through the body in its anatomical position, divides it into upper and lower parts.

The transverse plane is intersected at right angles by the vertically-oriented coronal (side-to-side) and sagittal (antero-posterior) planes.
