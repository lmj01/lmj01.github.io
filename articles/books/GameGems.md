1.1 Goals and Scope
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques, as outlined in Tessendorf 2001, produce incredible realism for sufficiently large sampling grids, and moderate-size grids may be processed in real time on consumer-level PCs看来快速傅里叶变换的作用之大，在GPU上的FFT是关键
1.2 The Sum of Sines Approximation
1.2.4 Texture Waves
