Chapter 1. Effective Water Simulation  from Physical Models
1.1 Goals and Scope
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques, as outlined in Tessendorf 2001, produce incredible realism for sufficiently large sampling grids, and moderate-size grids may be processed in real time on consumer-level PCs看来快速傅里叶变换的作用之大，在GPU上的FFT是关键
1.2 The Sum of Sines Approximation
1.2.4 Texture Waves
1.3 Authoring
1.3.3 Edge Length Filtering
