费曼访谈：磁铁为什么会相互吸引和排斥
all right? I'm not answering the question, but I am telling you how difficult a "why" question is.
You have to know what it is that you are permitted to understand and allow to be understood and known and what it is your're not
Now when you ask for example "Why two magnets repel"
there are many different levels it depends on whether you are a student of physics or an oridinary person who doesn't know anything or not
If you are somebody that doesn't know anything about 
all I can say is that it is the magnetic force that makes things repel
I mean I can go a little further back if I went more technical
but in the earrly level, I just have to tell you
that is going to be one of the thing you will have to take as an element in the world
the existence of magnetic repulsion or electrical or magnetic attraction
I can't explain that attraction in terms of anything else that is familiar to you

斯坦福大学和MIT是怎样教学的？
否定寓教于乐，因为那只是在最初的启蒙阶段需要。

>MIT不主张在课堂上讲笑话，不做取悦学生之事。因此在课堂上，总是教授们专注地讲，学生们仔细地听，教授需要通过严谨的逻辑引导学生往前走。MIT甚至不主张教授在课堂上使用比喻。你可能会觉得奇怪，其实是因为比喻虽然可以通过生动形象的联想帮助人理解概念，但如果要准确地掌握一个概念，比喻是不严谨的，很多时候也不符合逻辑。
