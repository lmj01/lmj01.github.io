## 透视绘画

Perspective drawing gives objects on a 2D surface a sense of three-dimensionality. 
There are two types of perspective: linear perspective and atmospheric perspective.

### Basics of Linear Perspective

When we talk about one, two, or even three-point perspective, we’re talking about linear perspective. It's a method of representing space in which the scale of an object diminishes as the distance from the viewer increases. Essentially, objects that are farther away from us appear smaller than those that are near. The position at which they meet at a horizon line (the intersection of where the ground meets the sky) is called the vanishing point.

一点透视视角是前面开阔一望无际，消失在远处
二点透视视角是正前面挡着视野，而左右两个余角无线延长消失在远方
三点透视视角是正前方，仰视看向天空，比二点透视增加了一个余角，消失在天空中
